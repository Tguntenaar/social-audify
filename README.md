# Social-audify

This was my first company. Together with 3 friends from my University we built a social media marketing webtool that enable agencys to quickly reach a lot of potential customers with the help of automated audits. We used Facebook's API, Instagram's API and a self build webscraper with the puppeteer sdk in PHP. We used wordpress as a shell to sign in and handle the payment process. (because we didn't know what we were doing). The rest was **pure** PHP HTML and Javascript with some JQuery. Without any front end framework and back end framework this was a pretty painful process since we were all still studying for our Computer Science degree. But hey, we have learned a lot on how not to do it.

We over engineered everything, we had rewritten the code base serveral times and launched way too late to get feedback from actual users.
